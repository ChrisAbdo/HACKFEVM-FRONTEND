# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.2)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

## Deploy your own

### TODO

- Creation Date should enforce a date - date picker maybe?
- File uploaded should replace the gray square
- Assign NFT previews - Images should be the same size, or at least scaled to the same width or height
- Assign page's NFTPreviewDialog's button should be a "Exit" button. Maybe a red X?

### DONE

- Available underline
- Clicking outside of the Assign dialog no longer closes

### Presentation Notes

- Setup demo address with oracle ahead of time
- Upload image to IPFS ahead of time
